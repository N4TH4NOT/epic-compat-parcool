# Epic Compat: ParCool

*This mod provides compability between [Epic Fight](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/epic-fight-mod) and [ParCool](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/parcool).*

## Overview

- Animations from Epic Fight are temporarily disabled during Parkour moves (with Fast Run beeing the only exception).
- Also prevents players from using any skill from Epic Fight while doing a parkour move.

## Further Suggestions

- Works well with Epic Fights `filter_animation` option beeing disabled (and I would actually recommend to disable this setting).
- I would also recommend to enable `no_mining_in_combat` and use [Epic Tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/epic-tweaks) alongside this mod if you seek a more immersive experience.

## Known issues

I have tested all of the available ParCool moves (by the time of this writing) and most transitions between the animations are decent to good. An exception to this would be ParCools *Dodge* roll. It looks a little bit off and I would recommend to disable this move and use the *Dodge Skill* from Epic Fight instead. ParCools Breakfall roll looks fine.
